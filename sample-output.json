        "paragraphText": "Aciclovir (or acyclovir) is an antiviral medicine. It treats a range of infections caused by herpes viruses, including cold sores, genital herpes, eye infections. Your doctor may prescribe aciclovir to prevent you getting these infections if you've had them before or if you have a weak immune system. It's also used to treat chickenpox and shingles. Aciclovir is available on prescription. It comes as tablets, a liquid that you swallow, an eye ointment, a cold sore cream and a cream for genital herpes. It's sometimes given by injection, but this is usually only done in hospital. You can buy aciclovir cold sore cream at most pharmacies and shops without a prescription."
